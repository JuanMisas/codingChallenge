Hello Jakob!

This is the project's progress that I have for now. I wansn't able to complete the project on time and it would take me more time to finish it. I tried to let you see by the code the structure of the application once it is completed but the app is not currently running as it still has pending work to do.

I recommend you to create the database with the migrations and then to seed the users table with the command "php artisan migrate --seed".
